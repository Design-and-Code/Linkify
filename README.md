# Linkify - All your Links in one

## What is Linkify?

A site that lets you include all your links in a single-page website with easy customizations. It gives you your own URL to share with anyone you want on the internet.

## Highlights:

-   Easily Customize the looks of your webpage based on your preference.
-   Dashboard Interface with good UI.
-   Have your own custom URL to your page.
-   Open sourced and completely free. Community can keep adding new features and customize it since its open sourced.

## Why this project?:

-   Everyone needs a website to quickly share which can have all their links together. Which is why an open sourced project can have more customizations and will be completely for free.
-   Good project for the community to build as well as use it for themselves. Since making a project which is not much useful for the community is useless.
-   Most of the other platforms have very limited customization and is paid feature.

# How to contribute?

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

## How to make a clean pull request

-   Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
-   Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
-   Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
-   If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
-   Create a new branch to work on!
-   Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
-   Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
-   Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
-   Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
-   From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch.
-   Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
    your extra branch(es).

If you have any doubts even though its silly or small, do not hesitate to ask the team for help/guidance. If you haven't joined our [discord](https://discord.gg/druweDMn3s) then join now, since further project discussions will happen on the discord server. Happy Coding!
